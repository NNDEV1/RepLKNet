# RepLKNet
Implementation of the large kernel net architecture presented in the paper "Scaling Up Your Kernels to 31x31: Revisiting Large Kernel Design in CNNs"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06717v2.pdf)

## To-do
* Make kernel sizes more dynamic(Only accepts large kernels sizes {31, 29, 15, 11, 9, 7, 5} that were shown in paper)
* Add re-parameterization as mentioned in the paper
* Maybe try to train on data
* Add .py files
